# Project "Snacks" - Software Modeling and Development  

This repository documents the development of the "Snacks" project, an application designed to simplify ordering and purchasing at the campus snack bar. It was created as part of the Software Modeling and Development course. The primary focus of the project was to build a robust model that serves as the foundation for the initial development phase and ensures a clear vision of all necessary functionalities and interactions within the app.  

During the project, we worked to understand user needs and create a detailed structure that describes every aspect of the app's operation, from user profiles to the internal organization of the code. Based on this understanding, we developed diagrams, prototypes, and documents that explain how the system should behave, always adhering to best design practices and the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern. This approach separates business logic from the user interface and data management.  

Although the main focus was on comprehensive modeling, we also took the first steps in development using Flutter, exploring features and validating the proposed design. This repository provides a comprehensive view of the software planning process, including everything from requirements research to code organization and documentation.  

In addition to the "Snacks" app code, this directory contains the files and documents used during the application's planning process:  

1. **Job to be Done**  
2. **Personas**  
3. **Use Case Diagram**  
4. **Class Diagram**  
5. **User Sequence Diagram**  
6. **Client Sequence Diagram**  
7. **Vendor Sequence Diagram**  
8. **Activity Diagrams**  
9. **Task List Used for Organization**  
10. **Preliminary Prototype for Client Feedback**  
11. **App Design Pattern (MVC)**
